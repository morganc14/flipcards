        <h1>Prosperity</h1>
        <p>
          Prosperity is a roleplaying game based loosely on Roger Zelazny's
          <i>Amber</i> novels. It includes concepts from the novels and the
          Amber DRPG, but the children of Oberon and many of the powers and
          secrets of the universe are different in ways we are discovering
          through play.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the game, Amber has spent much of its history at war, so it is
          noteworthy that it has entered a period of peace, and in recognition
          of this, Oberon has declared the <b>Prosperity Court</b> in
          celebration. His children have been called back from across shadow to
          celebrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is being played with a homebrew system taking influences from
          the Amber DRPG, Fate and Blades in the Dark. This site was created
          because trumps have always been one of the very fun parts of any Amber
          game, and we really just wanted to pull them all into one place.

            <h3>Site</h3>
            <p>
              Rob built this site as something of a learning project, so it's
              definitely a bit janky in places. For the moment, it's a static
              site (in order to simplify hosting) and things like the mobile
              experience are lacking, but it's slowly getting improved. Source
              is viewable on
              <a href="https://github.com/rdonoghue/flipcards">github</a> and is
              hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>.
