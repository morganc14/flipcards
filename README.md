# flipcards

## 3/16

TODO:

- need to seperate the redraw buttons from the length of the other columns
- the background cards aren't resizing with the actual trumps
- QUESTION: do I WANT the actual trumps resizing liek they are? Go back to pixels for the phone?

IDEA:

- Move the header build into Javascript so I can stop updating it everywhere.
- could I turn the flipcards from divs in to an unordered list?
