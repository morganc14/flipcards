# flipcards

## Small TODO:

- add some help text to the pages (tabletop, divination etc) so peopel know they can move the cards
- decide if I keep draw 1 (probably not?)

## Big TODO:

- Mobile is still half assed, but I'm not 100% sure how this SHOULD work on a phone
- Ugh, I really may need to get the data source switched over to JSON at some point here. No actual need yet, but it's getting cumbersome enough that I can feel the pressure.
- Same for a general site overhaul. Initially built this all kind fo flat. I pulled the scripts and styles into folders and that had helped some, but the tabletop keep getting more complicated, and I really should break it up for ease of management.

IDEA:

- Move the header build into Javascript so I can stop updating it everywhere.
