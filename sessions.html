            <h2>Session 1: The Wizard, In the Court, With the Candlestick</h2>
            <img src="/img/candlestick.png" class="sessioncard" />
            <p>
              A time of peace has come to Amber, and in the absence of enemies
              and threats, King Oberon has declared the Prosperity Court and
              strongly encouraged his children to return from their various
              pursuits to join the celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
              While few of his children are genuinely enthusiastic to celebrate
              what Liabelle describes as "celebrating murdering everyone", none
              of them are particularly willing to snub their father without a
              very good reason, at least not deliberately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Liabelle is, of course, in the thich of events, taking advantage
              of the court to wheel and deal. Cethlenn, still freshly past the
              death of her doppelganger, is still feeling out how things have
              unfolded in her absence. Borel rolls in on the heels of rather
              destructively dealing with an abyssal incursion in Montevalno.
              Borel's arrival is more good luck than intent, as Ramirez - the
              king's favorite messanger falcon - never reached him.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cabal takes the opportunity to meet at Borel's chicken &
              waffle restaurant in the city, to catch up and compare notes.
              While doing so, they spot Bevin coming up the throughfare, with
              the target of the forthcoming hunt under a tarp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Events culminate with a family dinner and Oberon's announcement of
              said hunt on the morrow, including the expectation that hunting
              will be done in pairs.
            </p>
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>
              Cethlenn: What kind of court is this again? Is it someone’s
              birthday?<br />
              Liabelle: No, Dad’s celebrating murdering everyone.<br />
              Cethlenn: …What kind of gift do you get for that occasion?<br />
              Borel: Candlesticks, pretty sure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besmer: Prince Borel! You are sorely missed in the academic
              halls.<br />
              Borel: Well, I’m sure your aim will improve some day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Liabelle to Cathleen: “When our brother fled - and I use the word
              advisedly -“ Borel, still in flight: “FLED IS CORRECT.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Cethlenn: I’ve had an ominous warning today.<br />
              Liabelle: From who?<br />
              Cethlenn: A riddler.<br />
              Liabell: Was it the cat?<br />
              Cethlenn: The reds are singing.<br />
              Liabell: It was the cat.

            <h2>Session 2: The Great Hunt</h2>
            <img src="/img/basilisk.png" class="sessioncard" />

            <p>
              In the morning, too early for many, the hunt is gathered in an
              area of thick forest not far from the ocean. Some of the notably
              pairings include:
            </p>
            <ul class="innerlist">
              <li>
                Cethlenn & Suil Lir - Relying on their shared cunning and Suil
                Lir's hounds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Liabells & Roichard - Looking to employe some "special
                amrnament" that Roichard has provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                Borel & Tribute - Tribute is a peacock who Borel rescued from
                the court. It had been part of a set, and its companion had the
                bad fortune of irking his majesty, to predictable effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                Diolinda & Fenella - Diolinda is here ot put on a good show, and
                Fenella is just trying to get through.
              </li>
              <li>Oberon is his own team. To make it fair.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A few others watched, but did not participate.</p>
            <p>
              Things took a turn when it was revealed that the beast Bevin had
              brought was not a dragon, but was in fact a basilisk. This
              resulted in a lot of changing of tactics and the withdrawal of the
              hounds, and, in general, a lot of chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, it was Borel who took down the beast, reveallign he
              had been feeding Tribute a steady supply of his own blood,
              transforming the creature into a firebird, which carried the
              basilisk off a cliff. Borel was largely embarassed.
            </p>
            <h3>Session 2 Quotes</h3>
            <p>
              Liabelle: "Borel, I have a question mark next to you. Is the
              peacock your confirmed second?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Duchess Karm: "I have to ask." She nods at the peacock. "Is that
              bait?"<br />
              Borel shakes his head. "Nooooooo, it's had a terrible family
              tragedy. This is an attempt to cheer it up."<br />
              Duchess Karm: "Well, your highness, that is an innovation I had
              not forseen. I'm honored that you're here at the hunt...
              ahm..."<br />
              Duchess Karm: "Does your friend have a ... name?"<br />
              Borel: "Well, yes, but every time I say it, people make a face."
            </p>
            <p>
              "I'm sorry, are you betting on a scenario in which Oberon is not
              both emotionally and intellectually distant from his
              children?" Borel to Liabelle on Oberon
            </p>
            <p>
              Liabelle: “Was there concern that you’d explode walking the
              Pattern?” <br />
              Borel: “That’s a concern people often ask about concerning me.”
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3>Session 3 Quotes</h3>
            <p>
              Cethlenn: “If I’m being beaten with a stick, I’m already in
              trouble and rummaging around in a backpack isn’t going to save
              me.”<br />
              Borel: “If I’m being beaten with a stick, it’s Tuesday.”<br />
              Liabell: “If I’m being beaten with a stick, someone is going to
              rue the day they thought of _that_ plan. I may even stop to thank
              them for the lesson.”
            </p>
            <p>
              GM: “I have to ask: Borel, how are you going to deal with forty
              feral hogs?”<br />Borel: “The hogs don’t even phase Borel. He’s
              doing the thing where he walks like a monster in a Japanese horror
              movie…”<br />Cethlenn: “I am going to have to ask you to teach me
              how to do that.”<br />Borel: “It involves going to the end of the
              universe, so it’s a little inconvenient.”<br />Cethlenn: “I’m okay
              with that inconvenience if it means no horses.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Liabelle: “You shot it with a bird and it wasn’t considered
              cheating.”<br />
              Borel: “I have a penis.”
